        <h3>Git - The enemy</h3>

        <p>
            This is not the first time I have come up against Git. Last year in our game dev course we were told to use GitHub to back up all our work. This is where learnt just how painful Git can be. During my first experience with Git, I spent much longer than I would like to admit watching videos on how git works and how to set up a Git repository. Once it was all setup, I could push changes and see my wonderful work updated on github. I was so confident in my git skills, but this confidence was extremely premature. I encountered this really scary monster called a commit error. This is when you confuse git by pushing changes that don’t match with files on the repository, so git decides that is will not work until you fix the mistake. This error is terrifying and takes a lot of googling to solve. So, after defeating my commit errors I should be a git pro… right?
        </p>
        <p>    
            This week was my first time using GitHub for html and publishing a website. Setting up the repository was straightforward. It was the same process that I was used to. I was intimidated by the idea of publishing my website. I thought it was something that would be extremely difficult. However, this step was really easy. Having the setup be this simple help calm some anxiety I have about the difficulty of this course and got me really excited to do more.
        </p> 
        <p>   
            In this course I am excited to learn the fundamentals. We were told that this course would not teach us the fancy stuff, but the right stuff. I am confident that I will leave this course with the strong base knowledge to tackle any problem I face.

        <h3>My goals for the website</h3>

        <p>
            The goal of this website is to serve as my professional portfolio where prospective employers can learn about the past work I have done. I want the user to see a professional and clean website. The website should show the full range of my skills and the quality of my work.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>User</b> <br>
            Target audience: Potential employers and peers. <br>
            Why: To find information about me and means to contact me.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Information/Content</b> <br>
            The content on the website will include my professional information and some personal information. A weekly blog will be available on the website that details my thoughts as I make my journey through website development. An “about me” page will have background information about me with my education, past experiences, and some fun facts. My professional works and projects, such as my GitHub, will be available for the user to find and view. My contact information will be easily accessible through the website for the user to find.
            <br>
            <br>            
            The most important information is the contact information; thus, it will be the most easily accessible from any page of the website.
            <br> <br>
            The most interesting information is the about me content and my professional works. This information should be presented first to the user to hold their attention.
