                Temu is the new online store that has come to South Africa. The store is being shown to everyone that is on the internet through their aggressive advertisement strategy. The retail website sells every item you can imagine at insanely cheap prices. The website has constant deals and price reductions on all items. This website is trying to steal a portion of the online store market. Advertising such great prices, everyone in South Africa is interested and has taken a peek at the Temu store at least once.
            </p>
            <h3>First Look</h3>
            <p>
                When the user opens the Temu website for the first time, they are greeted with the homepage. The website follows the same colour scheme as the logo. The background is white, and the text is black. Orange is used as an accent colour to highlight information such as the deals and prices of items. The orange does a good job of popping out of the page and highlighting information, but it is overused. There is so much orange used that the importance is lost. The Von Restorff effect says that when multiple similar objects are present, the different one stands out [<a target="_blank" href="https://lawsofux.com/von-restorff-effect/">1</a>]. The orange is supposed to the thing that stands out, but due to the overuse they all just blend into each other.
            </p>

            <h3>Jacob&apos; s Law</h3>
            <p>
                According to Jacob&apos;s Law users spend most of their time on other sites and have become accustomed to certain norms when it comes to the interface of websites [<a target="_blank" href="https://lawsofux.com/jakobs-law/">2</a>]. For a website to have good UI and a good UX, the website must not stray too far from the norms, and patterns need to be easily recognisable by the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                Temu is a new online store that is trying to break into the online shopping market of South Africa. To do this Temu needs to make themself new-user-friendly and make the experience seem familiar. They do not want the user to have to learn how to navigate the site and purchase items. They want this process to be as intuitive as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a new user to the website, one can recognise many similarities that it has to the other online stores, such as Takealot, as well as the other websites that a South Africans frequent. There is a navigation bar at the top of all pages, a search bar at the top, and the cart is at the top right. The words used for the buttons are also the same as other sites, for example “categories”, mean the same thing in the Temu website and other websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                The choice to use the Jacob&apos;s Law and make the UI elements recognisable to most people that use the internet was a good design choice. This does allows new users to enter the website, ultimately resulting in more traffic, more sales, and more loyal returning users.
            </p>
            <h3>Store Display</h3>
            <p>
                The products are displayed in a grid on the homepage as the user enters the site. The homepage items are based on previous searches and purchases, but one can search to see specific items. This grid display is similar to other online stores, but Temu differs from the competition on the product page. When a user goes into a product page, similar items are shown to the user as the user scrolls down. This keep the user in the loop of finding new products that they are interested in and potentially want to purchase. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With the wide consumption of shortform content such as TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts, scrolling to the next content has become second nature to the population. Temu capitalises on this learnt behaviour and provides an endless stream of products to look through and get lost in. It is unethical to present the products in such a way, as this pattern of scrolling can be addictive, and this uses this addictive aspect to push more products to the user.
            </p>
            <h3>Navigation</h3>
            <p>
                As stated above, Temu follows the norms of other websites. This includes the navigation. A new user can easily navigate through the website. Temu has easily understandable labels and recognisable symbols. The navigation bar is always available to the user from anywhere on the page and with this the user can find anything on the website.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal of Temu is to get the user to buy items. Temu does this very well by making it easy for the user to complete a purchase. From the homepage, the user can search for an item, add it to their cart, and proceed to the checkout in only three clicks. It only takes one click to checkout a full cart from any point on the website. This makes it extremely easy for the user to complete the purchase. The ease and simplicity of purchasing makes the user more likely to follow through with the purchase and not give up halfway through.
            </p>
            <h3>The Prices</h3>
            <p>
                Every item on the website is shown to be on sale and have the price reduced by a significant amount. Have items that are always on sale is a common place in retail [<a target="_blank" href="https://chainstoreage.com/news/on-sale-or-always-on-sale-the-risks-of-fictitious-pricing-in-retail">3</a>]. The sale price is then highlighted in a bright orange colour, so it stands out next to the higher “previous” price. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The products are presented as having much higher value and the deals are portrayed to be genuine. This is an unethical way to display the prices as it takes advantage of people that are ignorant to these practices, and preys on young children and elderly.
            </p>
            <h3>Limited-Time Deals and Demand</h3>
            <p>
                A tactic that is used throughout the entire website, is “limited offer” deals. These are deals that the user needs to act on quickly or else they would miss the savings. Words such as “Lightning Deals” and “Limited time offers”, and timers counting down all play into this urgency of these deals. These timers and everywhere across the website. They are under the prices on the store page, and also hovering under the “cart” as the user browsers the website. The constant counting down induces a fear of missing out in the user. It is this fear of missing out (FOMO) that results in the user being more likely to make an impulse purchase [<a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10496491.2023.2253228">4</a>].
            </p>
            <p>
                All the items that are displayed to the user have text associated with people buying the product. The text shows messages such as “Almost sold out”, “This user just bought”, “This user rated 5 stars”, “Only n remaining”, etc. This gives the products the perception of demand, thus increasing the user&apos;s desire to have the product.
            </p>
            <p>
                The above tactics are unethical design practices as they present the product to be scarcer then is it. It is the perception of scarcity, both in terms of the time limit and the high demand, that influences the impulsiveness of the user to buy the product [<a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1080/09593969.2022.2098360">5</a>].
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                The goal of Temu is to get the user to buy products from the store. To achieve this goal Temu uses good UI and UX principles to make the users more comfortable on the site. Temu has amazing navigation to help the user find what they are looking for. However, Temu uses many unethical design strategies to make the user spend more time on the site and buy more products.
