            <h2>Digital Colonialism</h2>
            <p>By <a class="p-author u-url" target="_blank" href="../portfolio/profile.html">Kellen Strydom</a></p>

            <p>
                For understanding what digital colonialism is, one need to look at the colonialism of the past. The <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/colonialism" target="_blank">Merriam-Webster</a> defines colonialism as “domination of a people or area by a foreign state or nation : the practice of extending and maintaining a nation's political and economic control over another people or area”. One&apos;s thought to definition and idea of the word colonialism is rooted mainly in history. This same definition can be used to define similar acts that are taking place in the present world.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Colonialism and Imperialism are closely related and are often used as synonymous. Both terms were forms of conquest that were expected to benefit Europe economically and strategically [<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/colonialism/" target="_blank">1</a>]. This was the historical colonialism experienced. One ruling country with many colonies underneath their rule.
            </p>

            <p>
                The reason for colonialism in throughout history was for resources. An empire would use its power to take over land and the resources that the land possesses. The Colonisers would be in control of the country, its people, and the natural resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                Modern colonialism is known as digital colonialism or tech colonialism. Unlike the historic colonialism is less direct in the coloniser&apos;s goal. Digital colonialism is more difficult to identify. This was due to the historic powers being countries and their means of colonising was do direct. In modern times, however, the colonisers are not directly the countries, but they are the big companies.
            </p>

            <p>
                Similar to the past, colonists today exploit the land for resources. Large western companies come into countries with “untaped resources”. These companies build communication infrastructure such as social media platforms and network connectivity, with the undisclosed intentions of harvesting data, churning a profit, and/or storing the data as raw material for predictive analytics [<a href="hhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/colonialism/" target="_blank">2</a>]. Big Tech companies try to have a monopoly over the internet and the technology around the internet. Microsoft are keeping government and countries using their technology, while preventing the adoption of free and open-source software [<a href="https://longreads.tni.org/digital-colonialism-the-evolution-of-us-empire" target="_blank">3</a>]. Google and Facebook have gone into many undeveloped nations and platform such as Facebook are seen as “the internet”. So many people are unknowingly being show information that their coloniser is filtering for them [<a href="https://longreads.tni.org/digital-colonialism-the-evolution-of-us-empire" target="_blank">3</a>].
            </p>

            <p>
                Labour is yet another resource that the colonists are exploiting the nations they infiltrate. Big Tech companies are from economically strong countries with powerful currencies. The difference between their economic power and that of the nations they colonise means that the labour is far cheaper. Big Tech companies can pay a person far less in one country than in their own country. Big companies, such as Google, are laying off many employees and moving the workforce to country like Mexico and India [<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/01/google-cuts-hundreds-of-core-workers-moves-jobs-to-india-mexico.html" target="_blank">4</a>]. The big companies are trying to spin it as moving resources closer to markets, but that is just not the whole story. The United States of America pays the highest average salary to a software engineer at $110,140 per year. When compared to India&apos;s average yearly salary of a software developer at $7,725, the answer is clear [<a href="https://codesubmit.io/blog/software-engineer-salary-by-country/" target="_blank">5</a>]. Big Tech companies are exploiting the fact that people that are living in a less strong economy can do the same job at a fraction of the price. This is the reason we have seen the trend of the big companies outsourcing work to developing countries.
            </p>

            <p>
                The above-mentioned trend by big companies has negative effects on a country&apos;s internal development ecosystem. An aspect of colonialism in history is supressing the people under the colonists. We can see something similar happening today. When a big tech company comes into a country they take the labour from smaller businesses. Startup projects have seen a shortage of developers due to a majority of the workforce is taken away by the big companies [<a href="https://restofworld.org/2023/cheap-developers-latin-america-tech-crunch-scarcity/" target="_blank">6</a>]. This has the effect of supressing the people and preventing any potential competition by smaller companies. This perpetuates the overwhelming rule that the colonists have over their empires.
            </p>

            <p>
                The South African Software industry is a steadily growing industry. It has seen massive growth recently and is forecast for more growth. As an industry there is a major focus on serving the domestic needs of the country. The industry is developing a wide variety of solutions. South African businesses are developing back-end support systems to web-based front-end systems [<a href="http://aisel.aisnet.org/confirm2016/70" target="_blank">7</a>]. Unlike other countries such as India and Malaysia, the main focus of the software industry are the needs of South Africa, and the industry is not controlled by Big Tech. South Africa is not seen as a better option for outsourcing for these Big Tech companies compared to other countries. This is due to the higher cost that would come with the labour here. South Africa has many labour laws that protect workers from being exploited. The South African worker ideology supports unionisation, and it is these unions that fight for the rights and wages of the workers. A company comes into the country would have to know what the implications are and be ready to act accordingly.
            </p>

            <p>
                As mentioned above, the presents of the Big Tech companies hinder the development of the software industry of the country. If a whole industry is working for something else, they will never be able to stop working for that thing. In South Africa, the industry needs to continue to focus on developing the software sectors and build for future growth. To fight the digital colonialism sweeping over the global south, the countries have to put forward their ideas and philosophies. South Africa cannot conform to the western way of life when it comes to the digital realm. South Africa is a vastly different technological ecosystem compared to other countries. South Africa needs unique solutions that the Big Tech companies are unable to provide.
            </p>

            <p>
                The youth of South African stands at a pivotal point in the future of the software sector in this country. It is the young people that are entering into this sector that will shape the fate and direction of the sector as a whole. There are two options that the youth is presented with: let the South African software sector be a victim of digital colonialism, or make a difference and steer away from the influences of the Big Tech.
            </p>

            <p>
                South Africa is a unique country and has unique people. The people of this country do not need a western company&apos;s influences. The South African software sector needs to invest in the South African way of think. The country needs to take its African approaches and philosophies into the software sector. It is the role of youth to decolonise the tech industry by stepping outside the oppressive rule of the Big Tech western companies. Power needs to be taken away from the western way of thinking and given to the people of South Africa that will develop solutions for their fellow countrymen.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the youth, we need to be courageous in our approach to the tech industry. We cannot fall into the oppressive norms of Big Tech. We need to identify when we are being supressed and rise up. The youth need to discover the best way to develop the tech sector in the country that is purely South African. We have historically stood up to our colonisers, and with this new brand of colonialism we will do the same.
            </p>
