                With the website JavaScript, I mainly focused on automating information that would appear on multiple webpages. At the end I started to look at the more fun and less practical things that JavaScript can do. I feel like I have just touched the surface for what I can do with JS.
            </p>

            <h3>Things I added with JS:</h3>

            <p>
                An automated navigation that will be populated on all pages throughout the website. This will make it easier to navigate the website and make adding more pages much easier.
            </p>

            <p>
                A previous and next button for the blogs. This will make it more user friendly and encourage the user to read more articles.
            </p>

            <p>
                I added a menu on the blog homepage that the user can go to a specific blog. This auto updates as more blogs are added. This allows users to navigate to a specific blog with ease. I did the same thing for the essays.
            </p>

            <p>
                I added a footer with JavaScript. We had just learnt about an h-card, and I tried to use this information to insert my h-card into the footer of most of the pages.
