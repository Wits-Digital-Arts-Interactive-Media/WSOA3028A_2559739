        <h3>Semantic Markup</h3>
        <p>By <a class="p-author u-url" href="../portfolio/profile.html">Kellen Strydom</a></p>

        <p>
            Semantic markup seems quite daunting, but I am learning that it is something I have to get used to and it does not have to be scary. Semantic markup is essential the agreed upon structure and format of html code.
        </p>
        <p>
            When coding anything, it is advised to keep your code structure logical and easy understandable. This is essence of what semantic markup is, but there are more real-world effects that the structure of your html has.
        </p>
        <h5>Why does semantic markup matter:</h5>
        <p>
            <u>Accessibility:</u> Visually impaired users interact with your website through a screen reader. These assistive technologies look at the html code itself to read the contents of the website. The screen reader will look at certain sections of the html, such as <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, etc., to effectively describe the information of the page to the user. Making use of semantic markup accommodates to the needs of this population.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Search Engine Optimization (SEO):</u> This is the act of making your website rank higher on search results on search engines. Search engine rank website that uses semantic markup more highly because structuring your content with the right tags allows the engine to know what content is on your page and can recommend it to potential users.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Readability:</u> The right structure allows the website to be understood more easily in the future. This will make maintaining the website easier.
        </p>

        <h5>Tags I have learnt</h5>

        <p>
            <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>: Contains the website navigation
            <br>
            <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>: Contains the heading of the page
            <br>
            <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>: Contains the copyright and contact information
            <br>
            <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>: Contains the main content of the page (the meat and potatoes)
            <br>
            <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>: Used for contents that can standalone and makes sense on its own
            <br>
            <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>: For information that cannot standalone and need context
            
        </p>
