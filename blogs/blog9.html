        <h2>Internet is a human right</h2>
        <p>By <a class="p-author u-url" href="../portfolio/profile.html">Kellen Strydom</a></p>

        <p>
            This week I read this article that I wanted to talk more about
            <ul>
                <li>Kasapis - 2020 - Internet Access is a Fundamental Right</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            I really connected with sentiment that internet access should be treated as a fundamental human right. I have always believed that more people need to have access to the internet. South Africa is ranked amongst the top of the countries in terms of internet cost. I always imagined a world where everyone would have internet access, and most of the challenges that this country is facing would be fixed by the population being connected.
        </p>

        <p>
            The 2020 pandemic was mentioned in the above articles as the being the thing that showed the world how great the divide is between the population with and without internet access. The country had to quickly scramble to provide the population without internet access. This took time to do and not everyone got connected. I experienced the lose of school time due to school being unable to teach all the students, therefore no one got taught.
        </p>

        <p>
            In South Africa there need to be a change in the way we think about internet access. In is now apart of society and one cannot function in this new age without being connected. This solution starts from the top. The government need to make it a priority to close this divide and impower the population.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the provided infrastructure and improved service delivery, the population needs to be educated. Resources also need to go toward showing people how to stay safe on the internet. Many of the people who receive internet access would not know how to use it to its fullest. We need to ensure that we benefit from this internet access as much as we can.
