        <h2>I am Learning CSS</h2>

            We are now staring on CSS. Very exciting. This is the stage where we get to make it look pretty. But before we dive into the pretty side of CSS lets look at how CSS relates to both HTML and JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, CSS is put onto bare HTML to change it from the default look of black text on a white background. CSS changes the structure that the html is presented to the user. Just like how semantic markup in HTML let the computers read the information. CSS helps the users read the information. CSS is used to present the data to the user in a readable way.
        </p>

        <p>
            CSS is the big daddy of styling the page. It creates the user experience that I &#40;the developer	&#41; what to present to user with. Good CSS will be the first thing noticed by the user. CSS can be used to hide bad HTML, but it is important to have a good HTML foundation.
        </p>

        <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
        <p>
            This the how the UI elements reacts to being stretched and shrunk into different screen sizes. This is extremely important for the as I want my website to reach the biggest audience and a large majority of the internet traffic is on mobile devices &#40;a quick google search say that mobile makes up <a target=”_blank” href="https://whatsthebigdata.com/mobile-internet-traffic/">60% of all internet traffic</a>&#41;.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mobile devices have different aspect rations. We also have to account for differing resolutions. We have to make sure it can work on all devices. The challenge comes when we try test the website on all the aspect rations. We are human and may miss a ration of phone screen and thus we are (unintentionally) excluding a group of people.
