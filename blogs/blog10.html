        <h3>My Answers</h3>

                The fourth industrial revolution is a major boost in productivity that is due new technology. This has a major impact on the economy as it increases growth. the previous revolutions had a single technology or machine that resulted in the revolution, such as the loom, lightbulb, electricity, etc. This industrial revolution has been incrementally approaching.
            </li>
            <li>
                Technologies driving this revolution are computer-aided design, internet of things and information sharing, AI, and more computing power in computers.
            </li>
            <li>
                The fourth industrial revolution (4IR) will have benefits in all sectors, including manufacturing, healthcare, finance, and transportation. All processes will be computer aided and automated. Computers will be used to simulate different scenarios making designs faster to design and safer overall.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 4IR will benefit the entire population of the world as everyone has access to it. The internet is becoming more and more accessible to the world. Access to the internet makes the tools driving this revolution available to the users.
            </li>
            <li>
                The biggest challenge of the 4IR is the divide between the population that has internet and the population that does not have internet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Government need to accept that the 4IR is happening and the people need to be impowered to use these tools. If the government invests in the people and the technology of the 4IR, the economy will grow.
            </li>
            <li>
                Coding AI tools that autocomplete syntax is an example of a technology that is driving the 4IR. It is increasing productivity and lowering the barrier of entry to programming.
            </li>
            <li>
                As mentioned in the above point, this AI tools that are available are greatly improving the productivity of the workforce. Another technology that is aiding the workforce is translating applications. This allows people to communicate across language barriers.
            </li>
            <li>
                With climate change being a problem that humanity needs to face together, we need to work together to ensure sustainability in the 4IR. There has been major outcries from people online for companies to follow sustainable practices. In the 4IR, people are more connected they they have ever been. This allows ideas about climate change and saving the earth to propagate through the world.
            </li>
            <li>
                I do not think that tools such as AI will take over the world and take the jobs of people. I think that we should not be scared, but curious about how we can use these technologies.
