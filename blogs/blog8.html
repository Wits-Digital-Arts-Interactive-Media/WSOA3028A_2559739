        <h2>Ethical Dilemmas in Software Engineering</h2>
        <p>By <a class="p-author u-url" href="../portfolio/profile.html">Kellen Strydom</a></p>

        <p>This week i watched the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wtvQZijPzg">Andreessen's Corollary: Ethical Dilemmas in Software Engineering - Bryan Cantrill | Craft 2019</a>. It is a presentation about ethical dilemmas in software engineering. Here are my thought about the video.</p>
        
        <p>Society is changing. When the rule of software development and the ethics were first thought about, software was a completely different thing in society. Back then software, the internet, and social media were not intertwined with society like today. The rules that were made in the past do not hold for the current society. They need to be updated to fit the present.</p>

        <p>While software companies were new in society, there were not many rules and laws to govern them. They could do what they wanted to do and how people reacted would determine what rules would be put into place. The companies did not care about collateral. They just wanted to make progress.</p>
        <p>
            When software is developed it is made by humans. No matter how unbiased one designs the software, it will always have the bias of the person that created it. This cannot be avoided and the only way to lessen the bias is for the software to be developed by a team that spans many different groups.
        </p>

        <p>
            Society is relying on software more and more. This is not a good thing for society. Having complete trust in a software could result in a catastrophic disaster. We need to bring back human validation in the processes. We should not rely solely on software.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is a culture that has come from software development. We want to make things fast. We want to take shortcuts. We donâ€™t want to think about the risks that come with that shortcut. There could have been many disasters that could have been prevented if the development was taken slower and more thought out.
        </p>

        <p>
            As developers we need to ask more questions. Questions that dig at how the software will affect the world. We need to not be afraid of the tough questions, because it is those tough questions that would make your software safer.
